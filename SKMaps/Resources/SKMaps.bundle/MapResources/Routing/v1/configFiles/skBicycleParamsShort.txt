/*
Configuration file for the parameters of a routing profile.

Comments start with “/*” and end on a line containing "* /" (with no space between ‘*’ and ‘/‘)
One line comments start with “//“
Any other line, which can not be parsed, will be ignored or trigger an error, depending on implementation.

Contents:
 - barrier penalty time - bike routing
 - surface penalty - bike routing
 - width penalty - bike routing
 - slopes - used in all profiles when slope-routing is on
 - general constants: used in virtually every routing profile. Be careful when modifying something. The implementation is very sensitive to some of the parameters.

Any input that appear here and is not use by the current profile, does not hurt.
I.e.: the bike parameters can have values in the car-fast profile, for example: no problem.

Each set of parameters is in CSV format, with a different number of columns and a different column separator. Historical reasons.
Details before each category.
A category is identified by the first character in a line. Details below.
The order of the lines/parameters is irrelevant and their order could be changed, even among categories.

/* ROAD SLOPES: penalization factors depending on road slope.
  - lines must start with “S:”
  - column separator is ‘,’
  - 2 columns:
	First column:
	   - represents the slope in % : the height difference divided by the distance travelled
	   - all values below -15 are considered as -15
	   - all values above  15 are considered as  15
	Second column:
	   - the penalization factor in %, for a segment having the corresponding slope.
	   - 0 means no penalization 
	   - all values should be equal or greater than 0.
Usage in cost computation:
   - suppose the following entry S, X
   - a segment that have slope S, will have its cost multiplied with:
           1 + (X/100)
   - so the new cost is: newCost = oldCost * (1 + X/100)

Remark:
   - the second column could have contain actually not X, but directly (1 + X/100).
So instead of 0 --> 1, and instead of 20 --> 1.2.
Percentages are used here because they seem more friendly.
Other remarks:
   - slopes smaller / greater that -15 / 15 are ignored
   - slopes in between -15 … 15 that are missing (or commented) are considered has implying no penalization (i.e. 0 penalization)
   - penalizations have to be equal or greater than 0 -> ERROR otherwise

/* The speed profile: those speeds are used for two purposes:
1. Define the preference to route over some segment-types (high speed in table), rather than of other segment-types (low speed in table).
For example, when the bicycles are specifically allowed, we use greater speeds.

2. Estimate the ETA. For this in fact another table, in a separate time-configuration-file, would be needed,
 in order to be able to play more freely with the speeds as in point 1 in this table, without breaking ETA.
That time-configuration-file should be common for more profiles (i.e. same route, same ETA, no matter of the profile).

Legend:
ro - means Read Only : do not modify, must be teh same in all the route-profile files

type-name       - the type name: read only
type-number     - the type associated index:read only
bns             - Bicycle speed on segments with Nothing Specified in map about bicycle access - used in route calculation
bsa             - Bicycle speed on segments on which bicycle routing is Specifically Allowed - used in route calculation
eta             - Speed used for ETA calculation
The route calculation speeds can be used to favor, or penalize, certain segment types.

//The bicicyle reference speed in Km/h. It should be the maximum of the speeds above.
//It is a "balancing" parameter used to convert the above speeds in penalization factors.
//So it does not influence directly ETA, or any route output parameter.
//Changing it affects the way the algorithm runs in terms of explored segments, how many and in what way. So indirectly it influences running time, memory consumption, route quality.
